The 1st layer is a soft airy surface, an airy wavy mesh enhances breathability, allowing air to pass through to the 2nd absorbent layer, and then air passes to the 3rd all around breathable sheet layer. Breathability that removes moisture and stuffiness is so important!\n",

            "A revolutionary concept of baby diaper that detects post urine baby infection. In case a child has urinary tract infection, the diaper warns the caretaker by changing the color of diaper. Urine naturally contains biological samples that can provide important information about a child's well being. Therefore it is an essential part of routine health screenings. It is particularly valuable in the diagnosis and follow-up of urinary system and kidney functions. This diaper is developed to detect bacterial urinary tract infection by screening nitrite samples in urine, thus it aims to pre diagnose uti infections quickly and allows treatment in a very early stage of infection. \n",
